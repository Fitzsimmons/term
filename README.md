# Base16 Gnome Terminal

[Base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) for Gnome Terminal should be used **only** if you don't wish to use [Base16 Shell](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell) which is the preffered way of setting terminal colors.

**NOTE:** All files in this repository are generated by a base16-builder 

## Installation
Firstly, clone the repo and source the scheme file of your choosing:

    git clone https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-gnome-terminal.git ~/.config/base16-gnome-terminal
    source ~/.config/base16-gnome-terminal/base16-default.dark.sh

Next, restart or open Gnome Terminal. Right click on the terminal and select profiles the menu that pops-up. The scheme you just sourced should be available for selection.
